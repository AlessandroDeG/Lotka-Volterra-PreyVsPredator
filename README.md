# Lotka-Volterra-PreyVsPredator

Particle simulation of Prey Vs Predators based on the Lotkaâ€“Volterra equations, implemented for the Particle Methods course at USI.

The dynamics of the system are quite interesting to observe, it looks like the wolves are pursuing the rabbits, even though each individual is actually just moving randomly.

Thanks to Prof. Igor V. Pivkin for the great course.
